// do: `(pointer: coarse)` is true for finger/stylus input, and a narrow
// viewport tells us to use the compact HUD. Either signal flips us to "mobile".
//
// The result is published as `data-platform="mobile" | "desktop"` on <html>, so
// CSS can key layout off it (see the responsive block in hud.ts) and game logic
// can read it via isMobile(). The class is re-evaluated on resize / orientation
// change, so rotating a phone or resizing a desktop window updates live.

// A viewport this narrow (CSS px) uses the compact HUD even on a mouse device
// (e.g. a small desktop window), matching the CSS media-query breakpoint.
