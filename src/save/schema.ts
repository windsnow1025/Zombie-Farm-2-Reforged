// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Save-game schema (Phase 1: Farm State Foundation)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A single serializable snapshot of everything the local, no-server game needs
// to restore a farm across close/reopen. Stored as JSON in localStorage.
//
// Design principles:
//   1. Persist SOURCE-OF-TRUTH mutable state only. Anything derivable is
//      recomputed on load: player level (from xp), sprites/textures, screen
//      positions, baseY, growth stage art, the wandering-zombie cosmetic actor.
//   2. Reference catalog data by KEY, never embed it. A planted carrot stores
//      "carrot", not the whole CropConfig — configs come from plants.json /
//      zombies.json at load time.
//   3. Versioned from day one. `version` gates migrations so later phases can
//      grow the shape without corrupting old saves.
//   4. Later-phase sections are OPTIONAL and reserved below, so a v1 save stays
//      small and forward-compatible (a v1 loader ignores unknown fields).
//
// NOT persisted, by design:
//   - Pixi animation state for farmer jobs. Local Farm persists semantic job intent
//     and restarts/replays it; sprites, bars, and partial walk paths are rebuilt.
//   - The wandering Dr. Zombie actor (pure cosmetic until Phase 3 ownership).
//   - Camera pan/zoom (a view preference, not game state).
