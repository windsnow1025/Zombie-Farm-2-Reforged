// The client half of daily / weekly quests.
//
// It runs in one of two modes, chosen once at construction from whether this build
// talks to a server at all:
//
//   OFFLINE (`authoritative: false`) — this system IS the authority. It generates the
//     sets, counts game events off the quest bus, pays the XP on claim, and persists
//     everything in the save. Exactly the same generator the server uses, so the two
//     builds agree about what a Tuesday looks like.
//
//   ONLINE (`authoritative: true`) — the server owns the counts and the claims. The
//     state is whatever the last projection said, and a claim is a command whose result
//     arrives as a new projection. Bus events are applied to a display-only COPY of
//     that state, with the server's own counting function, so the bar and the badge
//     move the moment the chore is done rather than when the batch window closes (up
//     to thirty seconds later — "my quests take ages to update"). The copy is thrown
//     away on every projection. What the preview never does is offer the Claim: a
//     quest done in preview but not yet in the server's count shows as `pending`, and
//     claim() itself reads the authoritative state — a claim the server would refuse
//     must not be offered, and that reasoning still stands.
//
//     The BOARD, though, is authored here. The generator is deterministic and shared,
//     so the instant this client qualifies for a scope (the level-up it just saw, or
//     a period rollover) it draws the board itself, shows it, and sends a
//     `quest.periodic_author` command asking the server to derive the same one. The
//     server never reads a quest off the wire — it re-generates and compares levels —
//     and its projection replaces the local board when it lands (identically, when
//     the level matched). Before this the board waited for the NEXT batch after the
//     level-up: the server rolled the sets forward before applying the commands, so
//     the batch that crossed level 5 saw level 4 and the star button arrived up to a
//     command and thirty seconds late, or on reload.
